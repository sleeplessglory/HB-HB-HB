            I'm drifting through the halls with the sunrise
            (Holding on for your call)
            Climbing up the walls for that flashing light
            (I can never let go)
            
            [Refrain:]
            Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
            (Holding on for your call)
            Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
            (Maybe not tonight)
            
            Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
            (Holding on for your call)
            Another drink just to pass the time
            (I can never say no)
            
            [Refrain]
            
            [Pre-Chorus:]
            It's a different kind of danger
            And the bells are ringing out
            And I'm calling for my mother
            As I pull the pillars down
            It's a different kind of danger
            And my feet are spinning around
            Never knew I was a dancer
            'Till Delilah showed me how
            
            Too fast for freedom
            Sometimes it all falls down
            These chains never leave me
            I keep dragging them around
            
            [Chorus:]
            Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
            (Holding on for your call)
            A different kind of danger in the daylight
            (I can never let go)
            Took anything to cut you, I can find
            (Holding on for your call)
            A different kind of a danger in the daylight
            (Can't you let me know?)
            
            Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
            (Holding on for your call)
            Taking the pills just to pass the time
            (I can never say no)
            
            [Refrain]
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            
            [Chorus]
            
            Strung up, strung out for your love
            Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
            I'm wrung and ringing out
            Why can't you let me know?
            [x2]
            
            [Pre-Chorus x2]
            
            Too fast for freedom
            Sometimes it all falls down
            These chains never leave me
            I keep dragging them around
            [x2]
