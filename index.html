            <dd>The song was released on 12 February 2015 as the album's lead single. According to Florence Welch, the song represents a new guitar-driven sonic direction for the band. "It's got very loud guitars and that was very fun to record actually", she said in an interview. "Trying to get exactly the right tone of guitar—I never realised how complicated that is. It took us forever.... Every day there'd be a different guitar sound. We ended up layering with three different guitar sounds, one on top of the other, in order to create this one song."</dd> <!--Description definition tag-->
            <dt><b style="color:rgb(33, 33, 219);">"Ship To Wreck"</b></dt>
            <dd>The song was released on 9 April 2015 as the album's second single. In a press release, Welch explained the meaning behind the song, saying: "I was thinking about my own self destructive side, and how you can make something only to tear it down, enjoy/destroy, create/devastate etc. When you're in that whirlwind, you often end up breaking the thing you love the most."</dd>
            <dt><b style="color:rgb(48, 93, 207);">"Queen Of Peace"</b></dt>
            <dd>The song was released on 4 September 2015 as the album's third single. On the face of it, this song details the bittersweet victory of a king and queen in a battle who despite winning, lost their son in the conflict. However, it seems Welch is comparing the royal anguish to her suffering in the relationship that is driving her away</dd>
            <dt><b style="color:rgb(87, 136, 239);">"Delilah"</b></dt>
            <dd>The song was released on 27 November 2015 as the album's fourth and final single. The music video for this song was directed by Vincent Haycock: "The cutting of the hair was a direct reference to the biblical [story of] Delilah, but then it veered off into something more personal to Florence. Since this song was always planned as being the end of the series, we decided to make it about [her] returning to her true self, killing off the ego version of herself, and finding her way home again."</dd>

Ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh
Ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh, ooh-ooh ohh

Good God, under starless skies we are lost,
And into the breach we got tossed,
And the water's coming in fast!

And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me, to make my bed
And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much?
Am I losing touch?

I was on a heavy tip
Tryna cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side
Like always, wondering what to do with life
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I <span style="background-color: rgba(3, 132, 225, 0.468);">was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side
Like always, you could never make your mind</span>

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion
That lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

You're a holy fool all colored blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage
To have me crawling back for more?
       
And with one kiss
And with one kiss
You inspired a <div style="background-color: rgb(98, 224, 240);">fire of devotion <!--Takes the text out of the line into the block-->
That lasts for twenty years
For twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?</div>

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

But I can't beat you
Cause I'm still with you
"Oh mercy", I implore
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?

            I'm drifting through the halls with the sunrise
            (Holding on for your call)
            Climbing up the walls for that flashing light

            [Refrain:]
            Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine

            It's a different kind of danger
            And the bells are ringing out
            And I'm calling for my mother
            As I pull the pillars down
            It's a different kind of danger
            And my feet are spinning around
            Never knew I was a dancer
            'Till Delilah showed me how
            
            Too fast for freedom
            Sometimes it all falls down

            Now I'm dancing with Delilah and her vision is mine
            (Holding on for your call)
            A different kind of danger in the daylight
            (I can never let go)
            Took anything to cut you, I can find
            (Holding on for your call)
            A different kind of a danger in the daylight
            (Can't you let me know?)
            
            Now it's one more boy and it's one more lie
            (Holding on for your call)
            Taking the pills just to pass the time
            (I can never say no)
            
            [Refrain]
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            
            [Chorus]
            
            Strung up, strung out for your love
            Hang in, hung up, it's so rough
            I'm wrung and ringing out
            Why can't you let me know?
            [x2]
            
            [Pre-Chorus x2]
            
            Too fast for freedom
            Sometimes it all falls down
            These chains never leave me
            I keep dragging them around
            [x2]
